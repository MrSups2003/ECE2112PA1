1. ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

Example: alphabet_soup(“hello”) ➞ ehllo
          alphabet_soup(“hacker”) ➞ acehkr

- So, for this problem, I defined a function called "stringsort()"
- Then, under this, I created a variable called "name," and this variable makes the user input a set of string
- I also created another variable called "sorted name," which joins the string input within the name and the sorted operation for the name.
- To end it, I added a print(sortedname) for the inputted string to be shown. Then add stringsort() function
- Here is an example of using my name. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a32b28-af5c-4d3c-a471-f9cab1b02c6f)

2. EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence
as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:

Example:

emotify(“Make me smile”) ➞ Make me :)

emotify(“I am mad”) ➞ I am >:(

- So I start by defining a new function called "emoticons()"
- Under this function, we created a dictionary called emotes that defines smile as :), grin as :D, sad as :(, and angry as >:(
- I also created another variable called feeling and it inputs the emotes
- Then the print function contains the sentence "Make me + emotes.get(feeling)" This concatenates the sentence.
- Here is an example: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ab98417-9078-40a6-894e-3bd27a05d904)


3. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first,
middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three
variables.

Example: lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: first: 1 

middle: [2,3,4,5] 

last: 6

- For this problem, I created a list called "numb" that consists of 10 elements from 1 to 10
- I created 3 variables called first, middle, and last
- for first, it will be the first element in the list
- for the middle, I will be slicing the element from 1 to -1
- for the last, it will be the last number of the element
- Here is an output: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5023459b-038d-489b-baca-f25b7c6ee5cb)
